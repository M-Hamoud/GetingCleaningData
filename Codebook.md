the data set provided has  variable of which we are just interested in 66, the subject and the activity. In the readme markup I explained in details how does the code work. starting from reading the data till writing the resulting data set after the mutations applied.
all the variable names are releatd to the mean or the standard deviation of the variables.
In the resulting dataset there are 180 rows (which is 30 subject * 6 activities) and each column has the maean of its corresponding variable in the 180 cases.
